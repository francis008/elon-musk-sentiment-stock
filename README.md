# 🚀 Elon Musk Sentiment-Based Market Signal

This project analyzes Elon Musk's tweets and predicts short-term market movements (e.g., TSLA or BTC price swings) using sentiment analysis and machine learning.

## 💡 Project Goal
- Detect high-impact tweets from Elon Musk
- Analyze sentiment using VADER and FinBERT
- Align tweets with TSLA/BTC market reactions
- Train an ML model to classify tweet-driven price movement
- Optionally visualize insights with a dashboard

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, yfinance
- VADER, FinBERT (HuggingFace)
- scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Streamlit (for dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and modeling
- `src/`: Modular Python scripts for production use
- `data/`: Raw + cleaned datasets
- `dashboard/`: Interactive Streamlit app (optional)

## 🚧 Status
MVP in progress — cleaning quote tweet data and aligning with TSLA market response.
